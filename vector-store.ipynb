By organizing vectors into clusters, we can enhance the retrieval process by narrowing down the search space and presenting users with more coherent and relevant results. Techniques like K-means, hierarchical clustering, and density-based clustering are commonly employed to organize vectors based on their similarity or distance metrics.\n",

Learning-to-rank approaches address this drawback by training machine learning models to rank documents based on relevance to a given query. Techniques like RankNet, LambdaRank, and ListNet utilize pairwise or listwise learning and exploit various features and signals to optimize ranking performance.\n",
